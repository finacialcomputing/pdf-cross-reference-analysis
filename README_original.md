# Cross-Reference Analysis and Visualization

This project analyzes cross-references in academic texts and creates visual representations of conceptual relationships.

## Project Overview

The project extracts cross-references from a PDF book, maps concepts to relationships, and generates two main visualizations:

1. **Timeline Visualization**: Shows cross-references as arrows on a page timeline
2. **Concept Network**: Shows relationships between key concepts as a network graph

## Files

### Data Files
- `DDM.pdf` - Source PDF document (89.8MB)
- `xref_with_pages.csv` - Extracted cross-references with page numbers (6.3KB)
- `concept_mapping.csv` - Concept-to-concept relationship mappings (4.5KB)

### Scripts
- `final_timeline_visualization.py` - Generates timeline visualization
- `final_concept_network.py` - Generates concept network visualization

### Output Visualizations
- `final_cross_reference_timeline.png/.pdf` - Timeline showing forward/backward references
- `final_concept_network.png/.pdf` - Network of concept relationships

## Features

### Timeline Visualization
- **Forward references** (blue arrows above timeline) - point to later sections
- **Backward references** (blue arrows below timeline) - point to earlier sections  
- **Chapter markers** (red vertical lines) with rotated chapter names
- **Curved arrows** with transparency showing reference density
- **Clean design** without legends or axis labels

### Concept Network
- **Hierarchical layout** - most important concepts at center
- **Bubble sizes** proportional to concept importance
- **Arrow thickness** proportional to connection strength
- **Arrow opacity** shows relationship intensity
- **25 enhanced concepts** with multi-word names
- **66 connections** ensuring all concepts are linked

## Usage

```bash
# Generate timeline visualization
python final_timeline_visualization.py

# Generate concept network
python final_concept_network.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- matplotlib
- pdfplumber
- numpy
- csv (built-in)
- collections (built-in)

## Statistics

- **279 cross-references** analyzed
- **19 main chapters** mapped
- **25 key concepts** identified
- **66 concept relationships** established
- **162 forward vs 117 backward** references
